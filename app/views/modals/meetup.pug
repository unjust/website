                    I worked for Meetup as a frontend Web Engineer for 8 years.
                    In that time I built a variety of user-facing features for both
                    mobile and web, as well as led the frontend web team and managed other engineers.
                    I was an early advocate for mobile development and the importance of having our website be mobile-friendly.

                .
                    Here are a few notable things I worked on while I was there:
    
    

    div(class='row border-bottom pb-3 mb-3')
        h3(class='col-12 mb-3') Group Create

        div(class='col-12 col-md-6')
            img(class='border',src='img/meetup/start_flow.png',width='100%')
            p(class='mt-3') Made with: 
                span(class='text-primary') ES6, jQuery, Python, SASS

        div(class='col-12 col-md-6')
            p 
                .
                    I was part of the small team to rebuild Group Create, the 
                    user experience an organizer goes through when creating a group. 
            p
                .
                    Since this is our source of revenue, it was important to make sure
                    the new design did not affect subscriptions adversely.
                    We implemented metrics and tracking to monitor conversion and 
                    measure how well the new experience performed.


    
    div(class='row border-bottom pb-3 mb-3')
        h3(class='col-12 mb-3') Event Create
    
        div(class='col-12 col-md-6')
            img(class='border', src='img/meetup/start_flow.png', width='100%')
            p(class='mt-3') Made with: 
                span(class='text-primary') React, ES6, SASS
        div(class='col-12 col-md-6')
            p 
                .
                    Although the design was also updated, the primary goal of Event Create was to replatform one of our core features
                    with the new technologies and stack.
