            I worked for Meetup as a frontend Web Engineer for 8 years.
            In that time I built a variety of user-facing features for both
            mobile and web, as well as led the frontend web team and managed other engineers.
            I was an early advocate for mobile development and the importance of having our website be mobile-friendly.

            Here are a few notable things I worked on while I was there:

    h4 Group Create
    div(class='row')
        div(class='col-6')
            img(class='border',src='img/meetup/start_flow.png',width='100%')
        div(class='col-6')
            p 
                .
                    I was part of the small team to rebuild Group Create, the 
                    user experience an organizer goes through when creating a group.
            p
                . 
                    We implemented user tested designs and made changes throughout 
                    development.
            p
                .
                    Since this is our source of income at Meetup, it was very important to get this 
                    experience right and not to affect subscriptions adversely.
                    To do this, we had metrics and tracking in place to monitor conversion and see well the new experience performed.

    h4 Event Create
    div(class='row')
            div(class='col-6')
                img(class='border',src='img/meetup/start_flow.png',width='100%')
            div(class='col-6')
                p 
                    .
                        Although the design was also updated, the primary goal of Event Create was to replatform one of our core features
                        with the new technologies and stack.
