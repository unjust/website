            Noesys is sound visualization software, using OpenGL to create animated objects and
            sound libraries to play and read audio data. The animations are powered by the sound data using an FFT algorithm and tapping into specific frequencies.

        .    
            This version has two animated sequences using the music of Fennesz and SND.
            The next version is being built using openframeworks and contains more animated objects and the ability to adjust and control animations in real time.
